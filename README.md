<h1>Hi, I'm Vivian! </h1>

I bridge the gap between business objectives and compliance obligations. As a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Analyst, I specialize in translating regulatory requirements into practical strategies that strengthen security, reduce risk exposure, and ensure operational resilience. With a sharp eye for gaps and a structured approach to risk management, I help organizations not only meet compliance standards but also build trust and long-term sustainability.
